### SYNOPSIS:

A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. The user enters a movie name it has liked in the past or want suggestions similar to that, after which movies similar to the name, character, cast or crew are recommended. Three main approaches are used for our recommender systems. One is Demographic Filtering i.e They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. Second is content-based filtering, where we try to profile the users interests using information collected, and recommend items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group cast and crew together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.
