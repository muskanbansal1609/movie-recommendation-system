### SYNOPSIS:

A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. The user enters a movie name it has liked in the past or want suggestions similar to that, after which movies similar to the name, character, cast or crew are recommended. Three main approaches are used for our recommender systems. One is Demographic Filtering i.e They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. Second is content-based filtering, where we try to profile the users interests using information collected, and recommend items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group cast and crew together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.

### FUNCTIONALITY :

The project makes use of various concepts like:

1) Python- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

2) Jupyter notebook- The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

### ABOUT THE DATASET :

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS :

Tools and Technologies Used : • Python 3.9 • Tensorflow • Keras • Scikit-Learn • Streamlit • Pycharm IDE • Tqdm • Numpy • Pickle
Any operating system : Linux , Windows , MacOS. RAM : Minimum 2GB

### EXPECTED OUTPUT :

The given recommender system would recommend 5 top items to the user based on the given movie name by the user.

# OVERALL APPROACH

1) Basically the user will enter a movie name , the name would be processed and we’ll get similar movies , like for example you liked some movie and would want similar recommendations. 

2) This same technique is used in Pinterest , Amazon , Google etc .
